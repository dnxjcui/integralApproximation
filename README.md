# integralApproximation
Approximates integrals through Trapezoidal, Midpoint, and Simpson's rule

<h1>This is meant as a general-purpose program that approximates integrals.
<h5>Created to avoid doing tedious parts of a math assignment. Do *NOT* take seriously.

Delve into the code and change wherever headers exist to match own use.

Note that Simpson's rule will return 0 if n is odd, as it is not consistent with the rule.
